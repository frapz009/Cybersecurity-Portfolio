# Professional-Statement

I'm working toward becoming a Security Analyst because I care deeply about helping people and organizations stay safe online. 
I enjoy digging into data, spotting unusual activity, and figuring out how to stop threats before they cause harm. 
My goal is to join a team where I can learn from others, grow my skills, and play a hands-on role in protecting systems and information.

What excites me most about cybersecurity is understanding how attackers think—how they plan, what steps they take, and how they manage to break into systems. 
I’m especially curious about their workflow and the tools they use to succeed. By learning how they operate, I can figure out ways to stop them. 
It’s a bit like reverse engineering their methods so I can build smarter defenses and prevent the same attacks from happening again. 
I want to be part of the team that stays one step ahead, protecting people and organizations from threats that often go unseen.
