## **CyberSecurity Portfolio**

I created a cybersecurity portfolio that highlights the diverse tasks and projects I undertook while pursuing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. Throughout the program, I gained valuable insights into:

* Writing code to support cybersecurity functions <br>
* Utilizing security frameworks and control mechanisms to guide operational practices<br>
* Identifying and addressing security incidents through intrusion detection systems<br>
* Capturing and analyzing network packets to investigate potential threats<br>

With this, it has paved way for me to pursue the following roles:

* Cybersecurity Analyst
* Security Analyst
* SOC Analyst

## **Professional-Statement**

I'm working toward becoming a Security Analyst because I care deeply about helping people and organizations stay safe online. 
I enjoy digging into data, spotting unusual activity, and figuring out how to stop threats before they cause harm. 
My goal is to join a team where I can learn from others, grow my skills, and play a hands-on role in protecting systems and information.

What excites me most about cybersecurity is understanding how attackers think, how they plan, what steps they take, and how they manage to break into systems. 
I’m especially curious about their workflow and the tools they use to succeed. By learning how they operate, I can figure out ways to stop them. 
It’s a bit like reverse engineering their methods so I can build smarter defenses and prevent the same attacks from happening again. 
I want to be part of the team that stays one step ahead, protecting people and organizations from threats that often go unseen.

## **What's to come**

This portfolio is a work in progress and will expand as I earn additional certifications and complete new projects. I invite you to check back periodically to follow my journey and explore the development of my skills and expertise. Thank you for taking the time to visit.
